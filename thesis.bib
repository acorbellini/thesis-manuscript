  Abstract                 = {Most recommendation algorithms in the context of large-scale social networks struggle with the need of an efficient exploration of the underlying user graph. Current solutions in the form of graph-specific databases or frameworks for graph algorithms do not scale well for processing complex navigational patterns. In this paper we present an approach for supporting social recommendation algorithms that operate with large graphs in a computer cluster based on policies, rules that allow users to throttle the amount of parallelism and control task location.},

  Abstract                 = {Link prediction whose intent is to discover the likelihood of the existence of a link between two disconnected nodes is an important task in complex network analysis. To perform this task, a similarity-based algorithm that employs the similarities of nodes to find links is a very popular solution. However, when calculating the similarity between two nodes, most of the similarity-based algorithms only focus on the contributions of paths connecting these two nodes but ignore the influences of these two nodes themselves. Therefore, their results are not accurate enough. In this paper, a novel similarity index, called Scop, is proposed for link prediction. By directly defining the contributions of paths to their end nodes and the contributions of end nodes themselves, Scop not only distinguishes the contributions of different paths but also integrates the contributions of end nodes. Hence, Scop can obtain better performance on accuracy. Experiments on 10 networks compared with six baselines indicate that Scop is remarkably better than others.},
